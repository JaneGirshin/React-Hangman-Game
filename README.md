# React Hangman Game
[Live Version](https://hangman-game-jane.netlify.app/)
> Hangman game build with ReactJS, including changing categories

## General info
I always had a passion for understanding the game development process, and what better way is to learn then building my own game?
This is a simple hangman game, build with ReactJs. I had a lot of fun and I've learned many things.
My biggest struggles were to find a way displaying everything, from the letters the user uses (buttons) to the words and category selected.
In addition, managing the wrong guesses number was another struggle. 
Overall, this game has many options and responsive, simple design :)
